This repository consists a collection of java programs addressing various problem statements

### Stick-length-problem: Sticks.java ###
Designing, implementing, and testing of an algorithm.</br>
 
This program determines if a combination for given length of sticks is present as the sum of known stick lengths. If such a set is present, it prints out one such set. </br>

Explanation:</br>
Assume given is the following set S = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 } and s_new, with length 5. The following combinations would add up to the length of 5:
- 1 + 4 = 5
- 2 + 3 = 5

This program returns one of such combinations.

### Sum-of-Prime-Factors : Prime.java ###

Compilation of a Java program, designing, implementing, and testing of an algorithm.</br>

This program computes the sum of the prime factorials for n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.</br>

Explanation: </br>
The prime factorials of 6 are 2 and 3. The sum of the prime factorials are 2 + 3 = 5. In this way, the program computes such sum for all the numbers from 2 to 10.
