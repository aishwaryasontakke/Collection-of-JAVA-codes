# Stick-length-problem

Designing, implementing, and testing of an algorithm.</br>
 
This program determines if a combination for given length of sticks is present as the sum of known stick lengths. If such a set is present, it prints out one such set. </br>

Explanation:</br>
Assume given is the following set S = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 } and s_new, with length 5. The following combinations would add up to the length of 5:
- 1 + 4 = 5
- 2 + 3 = 5
This program returns one of such combinations.
